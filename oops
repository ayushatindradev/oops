// What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

// oop is a programming paragigm based on objects,which contains data(attribute) and function (method).It helps in organizing code efficienctly.

// 2. What are the four main pillars of OOP?
// Encapulation-Wrapping data and function together
// Abstraction -Hiding implementation details from the user
// Inheritance- Acquring properies from another another class.
// Polymorphism- multiple form of the same function/method.

// 3. What is a class in C++?
// A class is blueprint for creating objects.It defines attributed(variables) and behaviour(function)

// 4. What is an object in C++?
// Car myCar; //object of class car

// 5. How do you define a class in C++?

// Student s1;
// s1.name="Ayush";
// s1.age=22;
// 7. What is the difference between a class and an object?
// class : A blueprint/template.
// object: A specific instance of a class

// Dod myDog;// obect

// 8. What is a constructor in C++?
// A constructor is a specal function that runs when an objet is created

// 9. What is a destructor in C++?
// A destructor is a special function that runs when object is destroyed

// 10. What is the purpose of public, private, and protected access specifiers?
// public: -> Accessible everywhere
// private :-> Accessible only within the class
// protected:-> Accessible in derived classes
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a class in OOP?
// A class is a blueprint/templete for creating object object.It defines properties (variables) and behavoiurs (method).
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is an object in OOP?
// An object is an instance of class.It has real values for p
// 3Ô∏è‚É£ What are the four main pillars of OOP?
// roperties ans can perform action using method
// Encapsulion (data hiding) , abstraction(hiding details),inheritance(reusablity) and polymorphism(many form.).
// 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between a class and an object?
// A class is a blueprint : an object is the actual thing creted from that blueprint.
// }
// 5Ô∏è‚É£ What is encapsulation in OOP?
// Encapsulation means wrapping data ans method together and restricting dirct access to data using access modifiers (like private).
// 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is inheritance? Give an example.
// inhertance allows one class to use properties and methoids of another class.
// class Car: public Vehicle{
    // 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is polymorphism in OOP?
// Polymorphism allows the same function to have different behavoir.It include methid overloading)same function name, differnt perimeter ) and method overriding(redefining a function in a derived class).
// }
8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the purpose of a constructor in a class?
// A constructor is a special methid that runs automatically when an object is created to initialise values.
// 9Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
// overloading=> Same function name, differnt parameters(in the same class).
// overriding=> Same function name and parapeter but redefined in a child classes.
// üîü What is an abstract class? Why do we use it?
// An abstraction has least one pure virtual function(virtual void funct()=0).It cannot be instantiated dirtly and is used as a base for other classes
